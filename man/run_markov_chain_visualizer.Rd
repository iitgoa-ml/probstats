\title{Learn Markov Chains: State Transition Visualizer}
\usage{
run_markov_chain_visualizer()
}
\description{
This Shiny app provides an interactive way to explore and understand Markov Chains
using a relatable example of weather states (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy).
Users can configure the transition matrix, set initial probabilities,
and observe how the probabilities of states evolve over time.
}
\details{
The app helps users grasp core Markov Chain concepts such as state transitions,
steady-state behavior, and the impact of initial conditions on long-term dynamics.

Key features:
- Validate the transition matrix and initial probabilities.
- Visualize the evolution of state probabilities over time.
- Analyze steady-state probabilities using eigenvalues or linear equations.
- Dynamic visualizations of state transitions, probability plots, and distributions.
