\title{Markov Chain Weather State Visualizer}
\usage{
run_markov_chain_visualizer()
}
\description{
This Shiny app simulates weather transitions using a Markov Chain model.
Users can configure a transition matrix, set initial probabilities,
and observe the evolution of state probabilities over time.
Visualizations include state transition diagrams, probability plots,
and pie charts for initial and final state distributions.
}
\details{
Key features:
- Validate transition matrix and initial probabilities.
- Visualize probability evolution over time.
- Analyze steady-state probabilities using eigenvalues or linear equations.
- Dynamic representations of state transitions and probabilities.
