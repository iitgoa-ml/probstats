\title{Run the Sum of Random Variables Shiny App}
\usage{
run_rv_sum_app()
}
\value{
This function does not return any values. It starts a Shiny application in the user's default browser.
}
\description{
This function launches a Shiny application designed to provide an interactive
and educational exploration of the behavior of sums of random variables.
Users can select various distributions, define their parameters, simulate
samples, and analyze both theoretical and empirical properties of the resulting sums.
}
\details{
The application supports the following distributions:
- **Normal**: Defined by mean and standard deviation.
- **Exponential**: Defined by the rate parameter.
- **Gamma**: Defined by shape and rate parameters.
- **Beta**: Defined by two shape parameters.
- **Chi-Square**: Defined by degrees of freedom.
- **Poisson**: Defined by the lambda parameter.

Features of the app include:
- Dynamic input interface for up to 10 random variables, each with adjustable parameters.
- Real-time visualization of individual distributions and their sum.
- Theoretical and empirical analysis of distribution properties, including mean and variance.
- Statistical summary of the sum, including a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and Q-Q plots.
- Educational explanations of key concepts like the Central Limit Theorem.
}
\note{
The app is designed for educational purposes and provides a hands-on way to
explore probabilistic concepts and the interaction between different types of distributions.
