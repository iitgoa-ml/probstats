\value{
A Shiny app interface to explore the Birthday Paradox and related random event probabilities
}
\description{
This Shiny app focuses on helping users build intuition about the Birthday Paradoxâ€”
the counterintuitive probability of shared birthdays in groups of people.
It also allows users to compare this phenomenon with other random events, such as repeated outcomes
in dice rolls, card draws, and coin flips, to deepen understanding of probability concepts.
}
\details{
The app includes interactive probability visualizations, event simulations, and tools for exploring repeated outcomes across multiple iterations.
